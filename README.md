# Numpy Basics Tutorial
In this Notebook we explore the basics of Numpy a library in machine learning and Data Science. Numpy stands for Numerical python. It is used to perform mathematical operations on numbers, vectors and scalars in python. It is one of the popular python library used worldwide. Numpy has the following advantages over python lists;
* It is more faster
* It is more compact
* Its performance is better
* Uses less memory to store data
  

## Array
It is the central data structure of the Numpy library
It can be referred to as ndarray i.e N-dimensional Array

## Attributes of an Array
- Fixed size container of Items of the same type and size
- The dimensions are called axes
